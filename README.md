### DRYFT

## The Skinny

DRYFT is a travel blogging and social site dedicated to those who are always on the move.

To signup, users must enter their relevant profile info, as well as select the city in the world they happen to be in at the moment.  Optionally, they can also include a profile picture of themselves.  Within the app, the user will be able to find and post about any city in the world as well as comment on the posts other users have made. 

## Behind The Scenes

Our project utilizes Django and a PostgreSQL database to provide a light, immersive and durable experience to our users.

## Our Efforts

DRYFT was created by Bryan Romero, Sri Edam, Josh Pardike and Jed Godsey, 4 General Assembly software engineering students.  While we faced many challenges over the course of this project, the most consuming narrative of the build was the team itself.  Working collaboratively with 4 different engineers provided some of our greatest successes when we were able to learn from each other and and progress more efficiently than if we were going it alone.  That collaboration was also of course one of our frustrations, as working through github issues absorbed a non-trivial portion of what would otherwise be productive working time.
