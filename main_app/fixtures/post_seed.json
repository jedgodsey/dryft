Highlights of Alexandria enclose a statue of Mohamed Ali, monument to the unknown soldier, the Mosque of Abu El Abbas and Qait Bey Fort which is built on the site of the Pharaohs of Alexandria. I vistied Catacombs of Shawaqafa and the National Museum, which words can not do justice ,you have to see for one self. In Museum was objects from Cleopatra on display. We drive to Montaza Gardens to view the summer residence palace of the former King of Egypt, Farouk. This was one of six ports we visited on our Holyland trip.",

While it is convenient to lodge here before visiting Machu Picchu, the commercial businesses & noise competes with the tranquility & majestic scenery of Machu Picchu. Many international restaurants & chains are open in the small area. The town square is an interesting place to sit, but would be nicer, if it was not surrounded by the restaurants & bars whose proprietors are loudly encouraging visitors to enter their cafes & bars.",
