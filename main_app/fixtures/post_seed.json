I arranged all the bookings and tours 3 months in advance via email since I live in New Zealand, and and the response was very prompt, no delays and all my enquiries solved. In terms of cost the company exceeded my exoectations. If someone here is looking for a serious and responsible Tour company able to book accommodation for you too, I highly recommend them.",

We drive to Montaza Gardens to view the summer residence palace of the former King of Egypt, Farouk. This was one of six ports we visited on our Holyland trip.",

While it is convenient to lodge here before visiting Machu Picchu, the commercial businesses & noise competes with the tranquility & majestic scenery of Machu Picchu. Many international restaurants & chains are open in the small area. The town square is an interesting place to sit, but would be nicer, if it was not surrounded by the restaurants & bars whose proprietors are loudly encouraging visitors to enter their cafes & bars.",
